  Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports




* Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your     local network to understand  network exposure.


* Tools: Nmap , Wireshark 




Description :
* Conducted TCP SYN scans on a local network using Nmap to discover live hosts and open ports.

* Analyzed scan results to identify common services and assess associated security risks.

* Utilized Wireshark for optional packet capture and traffic analysis.

* Saved and documented scan outputs in text and HTML formats for reporting purposes.



   *  Nmap was already installed virtually on oracle virtual box 
   *  Found my local ip range : 192.168.0.1
          Command used to find ip range is :  ip addr
          
 (Proof of concept attached )
  





   *  Command tasked to  run :  nmap -sS 192.168.0.1


Description 


nmap: This is the command-line tool you're using — Nmap (Network Mapper), a   powerful tool for network discovery and security auditing.

  -sS: This flag tells Nmap to perform a TCP SYN Scan, also known as a        "half-open" scan.

   * It sends a SYN packet to the target port.

   * If the port is open, it responds with a SYN-ACK.

   * Nmap then does not complete the connection — it sends an RST (reset) packet instead. That’s why it’s called half-open.

   * This scan is stealthy and fast, and is the default scan when run as root/admin.
192.168.0.1: This is the target IP address /local IP range — in most home networks, this is the router/gateway IP.

      *  Open ports found : 


PORT       STATE          SERVICE


23/tcp        filtered             telnet
80/tcp        open                 http
1900/tcp     open               upnp
      * Identify Potential Services And  Security Risks From Open Ports.


Port 23 — Telnet
      * Service: Telnet (unsecured remote access)

      * Description: Allows remote login to devices (e.g., routers, switches).

      * Security Risk: Highly insecure, as it transmits data in plaintext. It can be easily sniffed using tools like Wireshark.

      * Recommendation: Disable Telnet and replace it with SSH if remote access is required.


Port 80 — HTTP
         * Service: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

         * Description: Used for hosting web pages — standard, unencrypted web traffic.

         * Security Risk: Susceptible to XSS, SQL Injection, directory traversal, or misconfigurations if a vulnerable web application is running.

         * Recommendation: Use HTTPS (port 443) for encrypted traffic and ensure the web server software is patched and hardened.


Port 1900 — UPnP (TCP)
            * Service: UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)

            * Description: Used by IoT and networked devices to auto-configure on the network.

            * Security Risk: UPnP is risky when exposed externally. It can be used in DDoS amplification attacks or expose internal services to the internet.

            * Recommendation: Disable UPnP on routers unless absolutely necessary.
