# Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Task 1

This repository contains the completed work for **Task 1** of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship. The focus of this task is on basic **network reconnaissance** using tools like Nmap and optionally Wireshark to identify open ports and evaluate potential network exposure.

---

##  Task Objective

Perform a basic TCP SYN scan on the local network to:
- Identify active devices and their open ports
- Understand the services running on those ports
- Recognize security risks associated with exposed services

---

##  Tools Used

- **Nmap** â€“ For scanning the local network and performing TCP SYN scan
- **Wireshark** (optional) â€“ For analyzing packet capture during scans

---

##  Folder Contents

> _All relevant files are inside the `Task 1` folder._

- `Task1_Report.pdf` â€“ Written report summarizing the task steps, findings, and learnings
- `nmap_scan_output.txt` â€“ Raw output from the Nmap scan
- `wireshark_capture.png` â€“ Screenshot of packet analysis (if used)
- `open_ports_notes.txt` â€“ Summary of open ports and identified services
- `screenshots/` â€“ Additional images showing configuration, scans, etc. (if any)

---

##  Key Concepts Covered

- Network port scanning and enumeration
- TCP SYN scan methodology (`nmap -sS`)
- Understanding IP ranges 
- Risks of exposed services and unfiltered ports
- How firewalls and filtering improve network security

---

##  Submission

This repository was created and submitted in response to the internship requirement. All files are part of **Task 1**, as outlined in the official internship task PDF provided by Elevate Labs.
